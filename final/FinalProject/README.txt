The purpose of this program is to calculate the trajectory of a projectile given
the correct initial conditions. The program gives you the option of including air resistance, 
drag (from other fluids), wind, adiabatic density (air density varies by altitude), and the
Magnus Force (spin of the projectile) in the calculations. Air resisitance is included no 
matter what, but any combination of the other factors can be included or excluded in the 
calculations. The program prints two arrays. The first is the x position over time, and 
the second is the y position over time. Values with the same index in these arrays occur
at the same time.
